this edit done on fork before checkin edits on clone
edit made after create branch on fork and refreshing local clone (which made branch appear on branch menu)and then setting desktop branch to the new branch and editing readme in explorer - when did edit on fork and checked in before checking this in, check in failed; had to discard changes, synch, then redo changes, then could check in.
to make edits done on local clone visible in web clinet/fork, require (in desktop) not just checkin but a synch
references to checkin should be commit; and the synch from desktop amounts to a push from clone/local workspace to fork/server workspace (stream really as is shared): appears no private server side with a corresponding checkin action?
checking erroneous, is commit
appears clone analogous rtc local workspace
commit analogous to rtc deliver
no analogue to rtc checkin and rtc repository workspace?
the (github) fork analogous to rtc stream, in that it is the shared repo files (unless you fork with the intent of privacy, then the repo you forked off of would be analogous to the rtc repo workspace (but not really as can ber shared)
